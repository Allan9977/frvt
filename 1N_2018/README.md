# FRVT 1:N 2018 Evaluation
The FRVT 1:N 2018 will measure advancements in the accuracy and speed of one-to-many face recognition identification algorithms searching enrolled galleries containing at least 107 identities. The evaluation will primarily use standardized portrait images, and will quantify how accuracy depends on subject-specific demographics and image-specific quality factors.

**Participation**: Interested developers and organizations need to follow the instructions detailed in the FRVT 1:N Concept, Evaluation Plan, and API document to participate in the test. The draft version of the document, and its C++ interface header are now online for public commenting. Implementers should conform to this API (once finalized) and submit algorithms to NIST following the schedule published on the FRVT 1:N 2018 website.
