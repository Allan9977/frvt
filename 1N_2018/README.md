# FRVT Ongoing 1:N Evaluation
The FRVT Ongoing 1:N will measure advancements in the accuracy and speed of one-to-many face recognition identification algorithms searching enrolled galleries containing at least 10 million identities. The evaluation will primarily use standardized portrait images, and will quantify how accuracy depends on subject-specific demographics and image-specific quality factors.

**Participation**: Interested developers and organizations need to follow the instructions detailed in the FRVT Ongoing 1:N API document to participate in the test. The final version of the document, and its C++ interface header are now online. Implementers should conform to this API and submit algorithms to NIST following the schedule published on the FRVT Ongoing 1:N website.
