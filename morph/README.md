# FRVT MORPH Evaluation
Facial morphing (and the ability to detect it) is an area of high interest to a number of photo-credential issuance agencies and those employing face recognition for identity verification.  The FRVT MORPH test will provide ongoing independent testing of prototype facial morph detection technologies. The evaluation is designed to obtain an assessment on morph detection capability to inform developers and current and prospective end-users.  This document establishes a concept of operations and an application programming interface (API) for evaluation of two separate tasks:
1.	Algorithmic capability to detect facial morphing (morphed/blended faces) in still photographs 
2.	Face recognition algorithm resistance against morphing

**Participation**: Interested developers and organizations need to follow the instructions detailed in the FRVT MORPH Concept, Evaluation Plan, and API document to participate in the test.  Implementers should conform to this API and submit algorithms to NIST following the schedule published on the FRVT MORPH website.
