# FRVT MORPH Evaluation
The FRVT MORPH evaluation seeks to test performance of algorithms tasked with detection of facial morphing (morphed/blended faces) in still photographs and face recognition algorithm robustness against morphing.

**Participation**: Interested developers and organizations need to follow the instructions detailed in the FRVT MORPH Concept, Evaluation Plan, and API document to participate in the test.  Implementers should conform to this API and submit algorithms to NIST following the schedule published on the FRVT MORPH website.

**Website**: TBD

**Email**: frvt@nist.gov
