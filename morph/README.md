# FRVT MORPH Evaluation
The FRVT MORPH evaluation seeks to test performance of algorithms tasked with detection of facial morphing (morphed/blended faces) in still photographs and face recognition algorithm robustness against morphing.

**Participation**: Interested developers and organizations need to follow the instructions detailed in the FRVT MORPH Concept, Evaluation Plan, and API document to participate in the test. The draft version of the document, and its C++ interface header will become available online for public commenting in the upcoming weeks. Implementers should conform to this API (once finalized) and submit algorithms to NIST following the schedule published on the FRVT MORPH website.

**Website**: TBD

**Email**: frvt@nist.gov
